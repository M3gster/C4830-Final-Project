# C4830-Final-Project

Things to turn in: 

1) Link to GitHub: https://github.com/M3gster/C4830-Final-Project
2) Link to Instance (Unless you do a hybrid app): http://ec2-18-221-7-109.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/HackWeek/index.html 
3) Documentation for project
  - Names of all group members: David Heritage & Megan Cochran
  - How to use it: First you must sign in to access the website. This is done by either using your Google account or an email address. You must also choose a password for your account. Once you have an account created, you can log in at any time. After logging in, you may use the search bar on the home page to search for movies by name. After searching for a movie, it's information populates the page (includes the movie poster, movie title, genre, rating, director, actors/actresses, runtime, and plot). If the movie interests you, you may press the button below the information to add it to your list. You may also see a quick list version of your list on this page as well by pressing the button below the add button. To see a more visual list, click on the 'My Movies' button on the navigation bar. This will take you to a page that displays all the movies in a table view that shows all the movie information for all the movies in their list as well as the movie poster. For any movie poster (both on this page or on the home page) you may hover over the image to get a larger view of the picture. Lastly, when you are done using the website, you may press the logout button on the top right of the navigation bar to return to the sign-in page.
  - What technologies you used: omdb Api, Firebase, jQuery
  - Who did what: David Heritage created the base application and worked to create the firebase. He created the calls to access the omdb api and show that information on the website. Megan Cochran was more focused on styling and refining functunality/fixing bugs (some examples: stopped movie list from repeating itself and display properly, removed the no-image found picture from displaying when not appropriate, ensuring only correct data is shown when page refreshes, and added the logout button). She also made the documentation. 
  - What and where we should look for grading purposes
    - What do you want to show off in terms of hard work: Firebase authorization (lines 19-30 on home.html), movie information display (lines 65-114 on home.html) & movie list display (lines 33-65 in PersonalMovies.html)
    - What are you proud of that you accomplished: Proud of the functinality of the website and the potential it has if we chose to continue working on it. Could easily be tied into the to-do list homework assignments we have had and make it into a "Movies I Want to Watch" list and mark movies as watched.
